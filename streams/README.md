# Efficient Data Handling with Node.js Streams


Welcome to the "Efficient Data Handling with Node.js Streams" repository! This repository provides practical examples and demonstrations of how to leverage the power of Node.js streams for efficient data processing.

## Overview

In today's data-driven world, handling large amounts of data efficiently is crucial. Node.js streams offer a powerful and flexible approach to process and transform data piece by piece, reducing memory consumption and improving overall performance. This repository serves as a companion to the detailed Confluence documentation, providing hands-on examples to reinforce your understanding of Node.js streams.

Each example in this repository builds off the previous one, so it is recommended to start with the first example and work your way through the repository sequentially. All examples build off of the need to get a list of books, and then output them somewhere else. In each phase, we'll add additional complexity (and more streams!) to the example to demonstrate how to handle more complex use cases.

By the end, you should have a solid understanding of how to use Node.js streams to handle data efficiently, and how to apply that knowledge to your own projects.

Certainly! Here's the corrected version:

## Repository Structure

- [1. Simple Stream](1-simple-streaming): This example demonstrates the simplest use of streams, where book data is read from a file and piped to another file.

- [2. Adding a Database](2-adding-a-database): This example shows how to incorporate a MySQL database into the previous example. We use Sequelize to set up a readable stream (Sequelize was intentionally chosen as it lacks a streaming interface) and pipe the data to a writable stream, which is then output to a file.

> Fun Fact: MongoDB's Node.js drivers have a built-in streaming interface, allowing the use of MongoDB databases with streams without the need for a manual streaming setup.

- [3. Transforming Data](3-transforming-data): This example demonstrates how to transform data using a transform stream. We set up a readable stream using Sequelize, pipe it to a transform stream to modify the data, and then pipe it to a writable stream to output the transformed data to a file. In this case, we convert the Books data to CSV format.

> Fun Fact: The `csv-parser` package is a useful tool for parsing CSV data into a streaming interface, and the `csv-writer` package is great for writing CSV data from a streaming interface.

- [4. Compress It](4-compress-it): These books are going to be tightly packed! In this example, we use a transform stream to compress the data. We set up a readable stream from our data source, pipe it to a transform stream to convert the data to CSV, then pipe it to another transform stream to compress the data using `zlib`, and finally pipe it to a writable stream to output the compressed data to a file. For compression, we use the `zlib` package built into Node.js. This approach significantly reduces the size of the output file, demonstrating the power of streams in processing large amounts of data efficiently.

- [5. Storing it Remotely](5-store-it-remotely): Finally, we want to access our report from anywhere, so we utilize AWS S3 to store it. This example demonstrates using a pass-through stream to upload data to AWS S3. In our case, we take the Books data and upload it to Minio, an open-source S3-compatible object storage server that we can run locally in a Docker container.

In summary, by the end of these examples, we will have a report of books queried from a database, transformed into CSV format, compressed, and stored in an AWS S3-compatible object storage server. All of this is achieved without the need for excess buffers, filesystem writes, all thanks to the power of Node.js streams! Pretty cool, right?
